Snipple 1
expected output:

output for my implemention:
![image](Screenshot (149).png)
output for reviewed implementation
![image](Screenshot (144).png)
I think a small code change would make the program work for Snippet 1, 
as I just need to exclude the cases where there are backticks in the parentheses.

Snipple 2
expected output:
![image](Screenshot (126).png)
output for my implementation:
![image](Screenshot (150).png)
output for reviewed implementation
![image](Screenshot (145).png)
I don't think a small code change would make the program work for Snippet 2, 
as it is hard to detect which close parenthesis is the one to end.

Snipple 3
expected output:
![image](Screenshot (127).png)
output for my implementation:
![image](Screenshot (151).png)
output for reviewed implementation: 
![image](Screenshot (146).png)
I don't think a small code change would make the program work for Snippet 3, 
as there are lots of spaces and seperate lines for each link case.
