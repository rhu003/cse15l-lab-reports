# lab report 5 week 10
I found test with different results by searching through manually

## test 1 - 498.md
my implementation output:
![image](Screenshot (176).png)
provided implementation output:
![image](Screenshot (175).png)

Both implementations are not correct, 
the expected output would be a link in the configuration of foo(and(bar). 

## test 2 - 496.md
my implementation output:
![image](Screenshot (181).png)
provided implementation output:
![image](Screenshot (180).png)

The provided implementaions is correct, my implementation is wrong. 
This is not a valid link, so the expected output would be empty in the brackets.
