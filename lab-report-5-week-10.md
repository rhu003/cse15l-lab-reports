# lab report 5 week 10
I found test with different results by searching through manually

## test 1 - 498.md
my implementation output:
![image](Screenshot (176).png)
provided implementation output:
![image](Screenshot (175).png)

Both implementations are not correct, 
the expected output would be a link in the configuration of foo(and(bar). 

## test 2 - 2.html.test
my implementation output:
![image](Screenshot (169).png)
provided implementation output:
![image](Screenshot (160).png)
Both implementaions are correct, 
as it is not a formatted link
